# AIFruitCatcherGame
Through the use of AI this game is entirely been created. From the Idea to all the code and implementation of features and Bug Bashing. The only thing that hasn't AI created is the user testing for it. However I am sure that this will work.

Description:
"Fruit Catcher" is a fast-paced and addictive game where players control a basket to catch falling fruits. The goal is to catch as many fruits as possible within a given time limit, avoiding any rotten fruits that fall from the tree.
